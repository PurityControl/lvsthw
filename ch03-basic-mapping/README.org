#+TITLE: Basic Mapping

* Mapping

Mapping allows you to assign keystrokes to vim functionality. It is
one of the most important ways to customise vim to your own needs.

Mapping is done with the ~:map~ variety of functions. Mapping can be
done in each of the modes.

* Mapping in Normal Mode

To map in normal mode simply use the ~map~ function giving it the new
keystroke and the keystroke of commands you would like it to carry
out.

To map the ~-~ key to deleting a line, run the following command.

~:map - dd~

** Special Characters and keyboard modifiers

Vim's notation for describing special keyboard characters are:

| Notation      | Description                                                               |

** Commenting
You cannot and end of line comments to mappings as the rest of the lne
after map is considered a mapping instruction.

** Unmapping

Keys can be unmapped using the ~:unmap~ command.

~:unmap -~

** Listing the mappings

~map~ will display all the mappings in normal visual and select mode.

~map!~ will display all the mappings for insert and command line mode.
