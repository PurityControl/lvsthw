#+TITLE: Learn VimScript the hard way

* About this Repo
The repo is a walk through of [[http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com][Learn Vimscript the Hard Way]]. The book
is freely distributable providing it is not charged for or modified.
For further details follow the link above.

This repo though, is my vimrc being developed as I walk through the
exercises and my own notes in the form of a README summarising the
main points of each chapter.
